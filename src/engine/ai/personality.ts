/**
 * CPU personality: the weights that colour every level of the objective system.
 *
 * One personality is a bag of multipliers, nothing more. It is read in three
 * places and nowhere else:
 *
 *  - `objectives.ts` — strategic-state scoring and objective selection,
 *  - `objectiveScoring.ts` — how hard a legal action is pulled toward the
 *    current objective,
 *  - `index.ts` — how much controlled randomness the final pick tolerates.
 *
 * That is the whole extension point. A new opponent ("Grimble: aggression 1.4,
 * defense 0.8") is a new entry in `PERSONALITIES` plus a way to name it on a
 * seat — no second AI implementation, no branch in the planner.
 *
 * Today the only selector is the seat's `difficulty`, so the three built-ins
 * double as the difficulty curve. `personalityFor` is deliberately the single
 * lookup: when seats gain a named-personality field, it changes here alone.
