/**
 * Objective-driven CPU player.
 *
 * `chooseAiAction(state, memory?)` returns one legal action for the player who
 * must act right now, using ONLY the public engine API (getLegalActionIntents +
 * read-only state queries). The engine remains the sole authority on what is
 * legal and what an action does; this package only decides which of the offered
 * actions to take.
 *
 * THE FOUR LAYERS. The CPU no longer judges each action in isolation. It keeps
 * an intention and picks the action that serves it:
 *
 *     strategic state   EXPAND / DEFEND / PRESSURE / SURVIVE / FINISH
 *            ↓          (posture — biases what goals are worth having, and
 *                        owns economic policy: plant vs draw, gnome vs Wish)
 *     objective         CAPTURE_GARDEN(3,4) / DEFEND_HOME / ATTACK_ENEMY_HOME(red)
 *            ↓          (a concrete goal, REMEMBERED across turns)
 *     action scoring    existing tactical score + how much it serves the goal
 *            ↓
 *     existing engine   getLegalActionIntents → applyAction
 *
 * The point is legibility, not optimality: a watching player should be able to
 * say "Blue wants that Mushroom", and "Blue was attacking me until I threatened
 * its Home". The objective is held in a stack, so an emergency (DEFEND_HOME) is
 * pushed over the current plan and popped when it is resolved, uncovering the
 * plan the CPU was already on rather than a freshly-derived one.
 *
 * DETERMINISM. There is no `Math.random` anywhere: the controlled randomness in
 * `pickAction` is a hash of (seed, event count, seat), so a seeded game driven
 * from a fresh plan store replays identically (`aiFingerprint.test.ts`).
 *
 * STATE. The plan lives in an `AiMemory` the CALLER owns, never in `GameState`
 * — see `memory.ts` for why, and for what happens when it is lost (the CPU
 * re-reads the board and forms a new intention; nothing breaks). Callers that
 * pass nothing share one module-level store.
 *
 * MODULE LAYOUT (this file is the only entry point; the rest are internals):
 *
 * | File | Responsibility |
 * |---|---|
 * | `index.ts` | `chooseAiAction`: routing, the Action-Phase pick, controlled randomness, target completion |
 * | `objectives.ts` | strategic state, objective proposal, lifetimes, the interrupt stack |
 * | `objectiveScoring.ts` | how much a legal action serves the current objective |
 * | `personality.ts` | the weights that colour all three levels |
 * | `memory.ts` | where a seat's plan lives between actions and turns |
 * | `scoring.ts` | positional scoring — `scoreDestination`, `scoreActionPhase`, the BFS distance field |
 * | `cardPlans.ts` | `planCardPlay` + one deterministic target picker per card, and `cardKeepValue` |
 * | `decisions.ts` | one policy per `PendingDecision` kind, incl. both respond windows |
 * | `chatter.ts` | `idleChatter` — flavor only, changes no game state |
 * | `fly.ts` | the 'fly' seat: drives, learned incentive values, the fight brake |
 * | `util.ts` | small shared reads (own/enemy gnomes, home, difficulty, the desperation and turtle-breaker ramps) |
 *
 * Dependencies run one way — `index → {objectives, objectiveScoring, decisions,
 * cardPlans, chatter} → scoring → util` — so there are no cycles.
 *
 * The tactical heuristics below are unchanged — they still judge each action on
 * its own merits, and the objective bonus is added on top of them:
 *  - Roll-off: roll.
 *  - Home harvest: take a gnome while the board force is small or wishes are
 *    plentiful; otherwise take the wish.
 *  - Harvest order: economy first, dangerous flytrap harvests last.
 *  - Mushroom: clone the maximum.
 *  - Slides / tunnels / Snailmaggedon moves: score destinations (advance
 *    toward the nearest enemy home / center, avoid active flytraps, only
 *    attack favorably); entry effects are declined unless a destination
 *    scores positive. Piling friendly gnomes onto one square is penalized
 *    (spread out: ~1–2 per space, a 3rd only when it buys a fight), so the
 *    force fans out toward a target instead of marching as a single ball.
 *  - Respond windows:
 *      · fight — shield a gnome with Gnomebody Dies in a flytrap fight (only
 *        our own gnome can die there); in a home-stakes / late-game fight,
 *        swing the dice with 4 Leaf Clover (self) or Snake Eyes (opponent).
 *      · card — Nope-Gnome a card that would kill one of our gnomes
 *        (Rocket Propelled Gnome / Mushroom Cloud on our stack); failing a
 *        Nope, raise a Gnomebody Dies shield instead. Otherwise pass.
 *  - Action phase: build economy gardens as ONE defended cluster near home
 *    (mushroom with deep reserves, dandelion otherwise), capped by how many
 *    already sit near home — never dropped mid-march, which used to trail a
 *    line of abandoned gardens the AI never came back to hold. Plant a maize
 *    or flytrap near home to guard the approach, and a tunnel once one already
 *    exists elsewhere on the board (a lone tunnel has nowhere to link to);
 *    march gnomes toward the nearest enemy home / the Center Star while
 *    settling some onto the economy cluster to harvest it and digging in to
 *    defend it when an enemy closes in; attack when favorable; play Whimsy
 *    cards through `planCardPlay` (economy, removal, reinforcement and
 *    finisher moves — each with a deterministic target picker validated
 *    against the card's own `validate`); draw when wish-rich with hand room;
 *    end the turn when nothing scores above passing.
 *  - Discard (over hand limit): pitch the lowest static-value card.
 *  - Snailify: always continue as the Immortal Snail.
 *  - Chatter: the CPU says its plan out loud. When it adopts a new kind of
 *    objective it spends one quick chat on the line that matches ("That
 *    mushroom is mine.", "Get off my lawn!"), and otherwise falls back to the
 *    rhetorical musings it always had. That is how the objective layer becomes
 *    visible to a player at all — see `chatter.ts`, including the note on why
 *    a CPU that telegraphs its intentions is the point rather than a leak.
 *    Chat changes no game state.
 *
 * Roll-influencing / shield cards (Snake Eyes, 4 Leaf Clover, Gnomebody Dies)
 * are never spent proactively in the Action Phase — they are held for the
 * respond windows above, where they actually swing an outcome.
 *
 * Difficulty (`state.players[actor].difficulty`, per seat, default 'normal'):
 *  - 'easy'   — never plays a response-window card (fight or card), and its
 *    fight-commitment ignores the late-game desperation ramp while barely
 *    weighing being outnumbered, so it both stalls forever and walks into
 *    bad fights along the way. A deliberately weaker, exploitable opponent.
 *  - 'normal' — the heuristics described above; this is today's opponent.
 *  - 'hard'   — normal's heuristics, sharpened (see scoreDestination and
 *    planCardPlay for the hard-only branches). Positional rules of thumb Hard
 *    adds on top:
 *      · Don't wall yourself in: rather than planting maize/flytrap by its own
 *        home (which only limits its own movement), Hard drops them on an
 *        enemy's expected attack lane — a porch square facing us — as a Wish-tax
 *        (maize) or forced-detour wall (flytrap). Opportunistic: only when a
 *        forward gnome already stands there and isn't better off storming. See
 *        scoreForwardDeterrent.
 *      · Attack on multiple lanes without abandoning the start: this falls out
 *        of existing machinery rather than a Hard-only branch — the pathfinder
 *        routes the force AROUND a walled/occupied face (an automatic pincer
 *        exactly when one helps) and anti-balling keeps gnomes off a single
 *        square, while the standing home-garrison penalty and the economy-hold
 *        keep a defender back at the base. (A proactive pincer/spread bias was
 *        tried and removed as inert / tempo-negative — see primaryTarget.)

 *
 *  - **A veto stays a veto.** A negative tactical score means "this is a bad
 *    idea" — a flytrap walling in our own base, a garden nowhere near the
 *    cluster. EXPAND wants gardens planted, so a flat "planting is good" bonus
 *    lifted one of those above passing and Hard hemmed itself in. A bias may
 *    make an approved action more attractive; it may not approve a rejected one.
 *  - **Nothing is worse than nothing.** Anything the tactics rated above
 *    passing stays above passing, however badly it serves the objective. The
 *    case: a seat with no gnomes left and an enemy on its doorstep, where
 *    DEFEND_HOME's "don't invest while the house is on fire" docked the card
 *    draw — the only constructive thing left — until the CPU just ended its
 *    turn. Discouraging an action is not the same as preferring to pass.
 *
 * `drawCard` is exempt from the first rule, and deliberately: its negative
 * score means "you are not Wish-rich enough to spare one", which is a budgeting
 * preference rather than a judgment about the board — and the budget is exactly
 * what a posture is. A dug-in seat drawing down to its last Wishes is the
