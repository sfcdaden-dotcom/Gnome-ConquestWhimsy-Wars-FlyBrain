/**
 * The Durable Object wrapper around `Room`.
 *
 * Deliberately thin: every rule about seats, identity, secrets and the game
 * lives in `src/net/room.ts`, which knows nothing about Cloudflare and is
 * driven directly by tests. This file supplies the four platform-shaped things
 * the room asks for — sockets, storage, alarms, randomness — and nothing else.
 *
 * One DO instance is one room, addressed by `idFromName(roomCode)`. Cloudflare
 * guarantees a single instance per id worldwide, which is what makes
 * "authoritative state" a fact rather than an aspiration: there is exactly one
 * copy of the game, and every action is serialized through one event loop.
 *
 * HIBERNATION. Idle rooms are evicted and their sockets survive without
 * holding memory. On wake the DO has no `Room` and no attached connections, so
 * `roomFor()` rebuilds the room by replaying its stored record, and every live
 * socket is re-introduced through the same `hello` path a reconnect uses —
 * their identity rides along in the socket's attachment.
