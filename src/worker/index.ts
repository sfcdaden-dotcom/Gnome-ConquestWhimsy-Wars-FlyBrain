/**
 * Worker entry: a room API in front of the same static bundle the game has
 * always been.
 *
 *   POST /api/rooms            → { code } for a fresh private room
 *   GET  /api/rooms/:code      → the room's public snapshot (does it exist?)
 *   GET  /api/rooms/:code/ws   → WebSocket upgrade into the room
 *   GET  /api/health           → 200 when the database has the schema this code expects, else 503
 *   everything else            → the SPA assets, exactly as before
 *
 * Rooms are private by construction: there is no list endpoint and no lobby.
 * Knowing the code is what gets you in, so codes are drawn from a CSPRNG over
 * a 28-character alphabet — ~29 bits, which is not a password, but a room only
 * matters for the length of one game and holds nothing but a board.
 *
 * Every room is one Durable Object, addressed by `idFromName(code)`:
 * Cloudflare guarantees a single instance per id worldwide, so the
 * "authoritative state" the whole design rests on is a platform guarantee
 * rather than a hopeful convention.
 *
 * RATE LIMITING, here and in the room. `Room` meters what a connected client
 * may cost (see ../net/ratelimit.ts), but it can only do that once there is a
 * connection, and both endpoints below are reachable without one. So they get
 * a per-IP limiter each, for the two things a caller can do before any room
 * has agreed to hold it:
 *
 *  - `POST /api/rooms` mints a code. It touches no storage — the code is a
 *    CSPRNG draw and nothing else — so this limit is not protecting state; it
 *    is keeping one caller from turning a free endpoint into a code faucet.
 *  - Everything under `/api/rooms/:code` addresses a Durable Object, and
 *    addressing one is what BRINGS it into existence. That is the expensive
 *    door: a caller walking random codes creates a fresh object per request,
 *    each with its own storage and event loop, and no per-room cap can help
 *    because every request is a different room.
