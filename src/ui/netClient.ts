/**
 * Seat tokens, one per room — and, deliberately, one per TAB.
 *
 * The token IS the seat (see MULTIPLAYER.md), and the room enforces one live
 * connection per token: a second socket presenting the same token takes the
 * seat over and the first is closed with 4000. Keeping tokens in
 * `localStorage` therefore made two tabs of one browser fight over a single
 * seat — the second tab evicted the first, the room still saw one player, and
 * the host's start button stayed greyed out forever. Two tabs are two people
 * at the table; that is how anyone tests a room alone, and how a household
 * shares a laptop.
 *
 * So the live token lives in `sessionStorage`, which is per tab and survives a
 * reload — exactly the lifetime of "this seat". `localStorage` keeps a *claim*
 * alongside it: the token, the tab holding it, and a heartbeat. A tab that
 * finds no token of its own adopts the claim only once the heartbeat has gone
 * stale, i.e. only once the tab that held the seat is gone. So closing a tab
 * and coming back gets your seat; opening a second one alongside gets a new
 * player.
