/**
 * Local game session hook: holds the single GameState, dispatches actions
 * through the engine (EngineError → toast, never a crash), drives CPU seats on
 * a timer, and gates pass-and-play privacy between human seats.
 *
 * The screen-facing shape is `GameSession`, which `useNetGame` also satisfies
 * — GameScreen renders either without knowing which it has. The fields whose
 * meaning shifts between the two:
 *
 *  - `humanSeats`: the seats THIS DEVICE controls. Locally that is every
 *    human seat (hot-seat); online it is just yours. GameScreen gates
 *    interactivity on it, which is what stops an online client acting during
 *    a remote human's turn.
 *  - `dispatch` returns whether the action was ACCEPTED — immediately truthful
 *    locally; optimistically true online (a server rejection arrives later as
 *    a toast).
 *  - `revealedSeat` / `needsPass` / `confirmPass`: the pass-the-device
 *    interstitial. Online they pin to your seat / false / no-op.
