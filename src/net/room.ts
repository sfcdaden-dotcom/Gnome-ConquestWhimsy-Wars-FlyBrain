/**
 * The room: seats, identity, and the authoritative game.
 *
 * This is the whole of the multiplayer server's behaviour, and it deliberately
 * knows nothing about Cloudflare. Everything platform-shaped — sockets,
 * storage, alarms, randomness — arrives through `RoomHost`, so the rules of
 * the room can be driven directly in tests (`room.test.ts`) instead of only
 * through a live Worker. `src/worker/room-do.ts` is the thin Durable Object
 * that supplies a real host.
 *
 * WHAT THE ROOM OWNS
 *
 *  - **The state.** Clients never hold authoritative state; they receive
 *    `viewFor(state, seat)` and render it. An action is a request.
 *  - **Identity.** A connection is bound to a seat server-side, remembered by
 *    a token. Every action is checked against that binding before the engine
 *    sees it, so `{ player: 1 }` from seat 0 is rejected rather than obeyed.
 *  - **The secret.** The room draws the seed and the seal, publishes the
 *    commitment when play starts, and reveals the secret only when the game is
 *    over (see ../engine/setup.ts and ./commitment.ts).
 *  - **The CPU seats.** `chooseAiAction` runs here, on the same state, through
 *    the same `applyAction` path a human action takes. A CPU seat and a
 *    disconnected human seat are the same problem, and this is the machinery
 *    that answers both.
 *  - **The clock.** The engine holds no wall clock and never times anything
 *    out by itself, so the room is what decides a seat has stopped playing and
 *    applies the engine's timeout policy on its behalf. CPU pacing and the
 *    shot clock share one alarm, because a Durable Object has exactly one.
 *  - **The budget.** What a client may cost. Nothing a flood can send makes the
 *    room do something wrong, but every message costs work and every message
 *    that lands costs one send per connection — so the room meters its intake,
 *    per connection and per room, and hangs up on a sender that will not stop
 *    (see ./ratelimit.ts).
 *
 * PERSISTENCE. The room stores the *record* (config, seed, seal, actions), not
 * the state: replaying it rebuilds the state exactly, it stays small enough to
 * write on every action, and it is the same artifact the game is verified and
 * replayed from when it ends. See `hydrate`.
