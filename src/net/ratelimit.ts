/**
 * What one client — and one room — is allowed to cost the server.
 *
 * Until this file existed, a connected client could send as fast as it liked.
 * Nothing it sent could make the room do something *wrong* (the seat check and
 * the engine see to that), but wrong was never the worry: every message costs a
 * parse, most cost an `applyAction`, and the ones that land cost a storage
 * write plus one send per connection in the room. That last part is the sharp
 * end — a message in is N messages out — so an unlimited sender is an
 * amplifier, and the only fix is to stop reading.
 *
 * TOKEN BUCKETS, on two scopes.
 *
 *  - **Per connection.** The budget one client gets. Sized so that a human
 *    playing as fast as a human can click never sees it, and a script cannot
 *    hold the room's event loop.
 *  - **Per room.** The budget *everyone together* gets. This is the one that
 *    actually bounds the work, because a determined client can always open more
 *    sockets: per-connection limits multiply by the number of connections, and
 *    only a room-wide ceiling does not. It is set well above what a full table
 *    of humans can produce, so in practice it bites on abuse alone.
 *
 * A bucket, rather than a fixed window: play is bursty (a card with three
 * targets is three actions in a second and a half) and a fixed window either
 * has to be sized for the burst — in which case it permits that burst
 * *continuously* — or it clips honest play. A bucket separates the two
 * questions, `capacity` answering "how much at once" and `refillPerSecond`
 * answering "how much forever".
 *
 * DELIBERATELY IN MEMORY. Buckets are never persisted. Writing one to storage
 * per message would cost more than the messages we are defending against, and
 * the failure mode of losing them is that a room evicted from memory forgives
 * whatever a flooder had spent — which requires the flooder to have stopped
 * sending for long enough to let the room hibernate, i.e. to have stopped being
 * a flooder. The hard cap on concurrent connections (`MAX_CONNECTIONS`) is what
 * covers the case buckets cannot: it is a property of the room's live socket
 * set, so it survives being forgotten.

/**
 * What each kind of message costs to serve, in tokens.

 * Weighted rather than flat, because the messages differ by more than an order
 * of magnitude in what they ask for:
 *
 *  - `ping` is answered with `pong` and touches nothing. A real client sends
 *    one every 45 seconds to keep middleboxes from reaping the socket.
 *  - `action` runs the engine, appends to the record, writes storage, and
 *    sends a separately-redacted state to every connection. It is also the
 *    only one a client sends in bulk, so its cost sets the sustained rate.
 *  - `configure` rewrites the lobby and broadcasts it. Cheaper than an action
 *    (no engine, no record) but a host toggling seats does it in bursts.
 *  - `start` deals a whole game: a `createGame`, a seal, a full broadcast.
 *  - `hello` re-settles identity, reseats spectators, writes storage and
 *    broadcasts. A legitimate client sends exactly one per connection, so the
 *    price is set to make repeats pointless rather than to leave room for them.
 *  - `takeOverRoom` rewrites who owns the room and broadcasts it. Priced like
 *    `start`: it is a once-per-room button, and the room refuses it outright
 *    unless there is genuinely no host, so repeats are pure waste.
